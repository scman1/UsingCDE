# UsingCDE
Examples using Chem Data Extractor

A demonstrator of basic use of Chem Data Extractor using jupyter notebooks 

Jupyter Example Files:
  1. **CDE Getting Started.ipynb**   Basic example repeating the initial steps in the CDE documentation
  2. **Read PDF File.ipynb**         Example reading a single file
  3. **Read CSV List.ipynb**         Example reading from a csv list, modified from the example of cde_read_files.py
  4. **Read HTML File.ipynb**        Example reading a single HTML document from the web (creating a temporary local copy)
  5. **Read HTML List.ipynb**        Example reading URLs from a csv list
  
Python Example Files: 
  1. **cde_demo.py**         script running the same comands as the two jupyter notebooks
  2. **cde_read_files.py**   script for reading several pdf files from a directory, runs from the command line:
                         python cde_read_files.py ./pdfs
  3. **cde_read_html.py**    script for reading an online HTML document (derived from Jupyter example 4)
                        
The code does not include the example input pdf file, this can be downloaded from https://pubs.rsc.org/ko/content/articlehtml/2019/cp/c8cp05975f
